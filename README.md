# Handwritten Character Recognition

This project is about recognizing handwritten characters using Machine Learning. The model is trained to take images of handwritten characters and classify them correctly.

# What I Learned 

How to preprocess handwritten image datasets

How to extract features from images for training

How neural networks can be applied to character recognition

Improving accuracy through training and evaluation

# Tech Stack 

Python

NumPy, Pandas

Matplotlib (for visualization)

TensorFlow / Keras (for model training)

# How It Works 

The dataset of handwritten characters is preprocessed (resized, normalized, etc.).

Features are extracted and fed into a neural network.

The model is trained and tested.

Finally, the system can recognize handwritten input.
